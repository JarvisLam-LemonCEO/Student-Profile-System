# Student Profile Management System

A **React + Vite web application** that allows teachers to manage classes and student profiles. The system supports class management, student records, grade tracking, notes, and skill visualization using a hexagon radar chart.

All data is stored locally in the browser using **localStorage**, so no backend server is required.

# How Data is Stored

All data is stored in **browser localStorage**.

Keys used:
1. student_profile_users
2. student_profile_classes
3. student_profile_current_user


Example student structure:

```json
{
  "id": "student1",
  "name": "Alice",
  "studentId": "S1001",
  "image": "base64image",
  "skills": {
    "communication": 80,
    "teamwork": 75,
    "problemSolving": 85,
    "leadership": 70,
    "creativity": 78,
    "discipline": 90
  },
  "grades": [],
  "notes": []
}
```

# Limitations

Because this project uses localStorage:

Data only exists on the current browser

Clearing browser storage removes all data

Passwords are not encrypted

Not suitable for production environments

This design is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.

Future Improvements

Possible enhancements:

Backend API (Node.js + Express)

Database integration (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)

Secure authentication with hashed passwords

Multiple teacher accounts

Student search and filtering

Export/import class data

Dark mode support

Image compression

License

This project is for educational purposes.

If you want, I can also make a **much more professional GitHub README** with:

- badges (React, Vite, Tailwind)
- system architecture diagram
- UI screenshots section
- animated demo GIF
- table of contents
- clean section navigation

It will look **like a real production repository**.
